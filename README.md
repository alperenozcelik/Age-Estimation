# AgeEstimation

This was an assignment given to us in a machine learning course.
Our goal in this assignment was to estimate the ages of the people 
in the test set by creating our own KNN and weighted KNN classes.

I couldn't upload all of the images we used in the project because they were too many.
Images folder contains 90 of 900 dataset images
